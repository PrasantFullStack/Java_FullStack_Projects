What is C Compiler:
---------------------
A compiler is a software that converts the source code to the object code. 

In other words, we can say that it converts the high-level language to machine/binary language. Moreover, it is necessary to perform this step to make the program executable. 

This is because the computer understands only binary language.

What is C Compiler:
---------------------
A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code, bytecode or another programming language. 

The source code is typically written in a high-level, human-readable language such as Java or C++.

What is C Compiler:
--------------------
a computer program that translates an entire set of instructions written in a higher-level symbolic language (such as C) into machine language before the instructions can be executed.



What is C Interpreter:
---------------------
An interpreter translates the code line-by-line when the program is running.

Difference B/W Compiler and Interpreter:
-----------------------------------------
A compiler is defined as a software that transforms an entire set of source code into object code and saves it as a file before executing it. 

Conversely, an interpreter converts and executes source code line by line without saving it and points out errors along the way.
----
Compiled language follows at least two levels to get from source code to execution.

Interpreted language follows one step to get from source code to execution.

What is called interpreter in computer?
------------------------------------------
An interpreter is a program that directly executes the instructions in a high-level language, without converting it into machine code. 

In programming, we can execute a program in two ways. Firstly, through compilation and secondly, through an interpreter. 

The common way is to use a compiler.


Is compiler faster than interpreter?
--------------------------------------
A compiler typically runs a program faster because it translates an entire program at once. 

Meanwhile, the interpreter translates a program line by line. 

This makes its overall speed and execution slower.


Which is an interpreter language?
---------------------------------
An interpreted language is a language in which the implementations execute instructions directly without earlier compiling a program into machine language. 

The compiled programs run faster than interpreted programs.



What is library in C language?
---------------------------------
Library functions in C are also inbuilt functions in C language. 

These inbuilt functions are located in some common location, and it is known as the library. 

All the functions are used to execute a particular operation. 

These library functions are generally preferred to obtain the predefined output.

Note:
------
The C standard library or libc is the standard library for the C programming language.
